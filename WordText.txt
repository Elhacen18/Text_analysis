CHAPTER1

THE DIFFERENT AND MOST REMARKABLE SPECIES OF THE WHALE TRIBE

    Nature strange work vast Whales of different form
    Toss up the troubled flood and are themselves a storm
    Uncouth the sight when they in dreadful play
    Discharge their nostrils and refund a sea


You recollect my son that some time since in a mornings walk you
pointed out to me an enormous arch over a field gate which I told you
was formed of the jawbones of the whale and I then promised you an
account of these enormous fishes Among the numberless tribes of living
animals that people the northern seas the class of whales are by far
the largest and although living in the water they are in many respects
similar to quadrupeds they not only bring forth their young alive but
suckle them as do the land animals they have also a thick layer of
fatty substance called blubber surrounding their whole body beneath
the skin and it is by this covering my son that Providence enables
them to defy the most dreadful extremities of cold even under the ice
at the Poles Although they are the mightiest animals that swim the
ocean stream their bulk has been often exaggerated they being rarely
more than 60 feet long which implies a weight of 70 tons being nearly
that of 300 fat oxen The tail is the most active limb of this mighty
animal its power is tremendous a single blow throws a large boat with
its crew into the air There are several varieties of the whale The most
dangerous one is the Razor Back which is longer than the Common Black or
Right Whale and although smaller in circumference is a more powerful
animal swimming at the rate of twelve miles an hour and has been known
to run off 480 fathoms of line with a harpoon attached to him in one
minute They are difficult to obtain often obliging the sailors to cut
the line in order to escape destruction but as this species contains
only ten or twelve tons of oil of an inferior quality the whalers
generally shun his encounter sometimes however they mistake him in the
water for the common one The other species of whale eagerly sought after
by man is the Cachalot or Spermaceti this animal is almost invariably
found in large herds of from 150 to 200

CHAPTER2

MODE OF LIVINGMANNER OF TAKING THEIR FOOD c


The Spermaceti as well as the Common Whale feeds on the smallest insects
or animalcula of the ocean its capacious mouth with the vast fringes
of whalebone attached to the inside of its mouth is a most excellent
filter enabling it to receive a large quantity of water at a mouthful
and to separate the seaweed and gravel from it even of the size of a
pins head This substance called whalebone is taken from the upper
jaw of the animal and is very different from the real bones which
resemble those of great land animals When we reflect my son that the
same almighty power whose will has formed the immense whale has also
given animation and senses to the smallest sea insects which are the food
of this marine monster how must our pride be lowered while we are so
unable to comprehend the mechanism which puts them in motion and much
less that intelligence and power which has given them life Let us then
exclaim in astonishment and gratitude with the sweet singer of Israel
O Lord how inscrutable are thy ways how magnificent thy works As
the whale must rise to the surface of the sea to breathe its tail is
placed horizontally to enable it to ascend and descend more quickly
This animal is dull of hearing although its sense of seeing is acute
They will discover one another in clear water when under the surface at
an amazing distance when at the top of the water however they do not
see far They have no voice but in breathing or blowing they make a
very loud noise they throw the water through their blow holes which
are situated upon the head many yards high which looks at a distance
like a puff of smoke and when the whale is wounded is often red with
blood Although this animal is so large it will sometimes descend
perpendicularly after being harpooned at the astonishing velocity of
eight miles an hour their usual rate of swimming when not pursued is
never more than half that number They are seldom found asleep they are
however occasionally found sleeping in calm weather among the ice in
northern latitudes When the whale feeds it swims pretty swiftly with
its mouth open just below the surface of the sea This animal has but one
young at a time which is from ten to fifteen feet long at its birth it
goes with its mother for at least one year until it is supposed that
the whalebone or filter has grown sufficient to enable it to procure its
own food The love of the whale for its young is great so that whalers
whenever they can harpoon them are pretty sure of getting its parent
for whenever the young rises to the surface of the water to breathe the
old whale will join and encourage it to swim off and will often take it
under her fin and seldom deserts it while life remains I will give
you William tomorrow an incident which took place in 1811 on board
of a Northern Whaler

CHAPTER3

THE TAKING OF A WHALE WITH HER YOUNGITS ENEMIES c

In the spring of 1811 on board of Capt Scoresbys ship one of the
harpooners struck a young whale with the hope of its leading to the
capture of its mother Presently she arose close by his boat and
seizing its young one dragged out nearly 100 fathoms of line with
amazing swiftness Again she arose to the surface darted furiously on
and appeared in great agony seemingly regardless of the danger which
surrounded her At length one of the boats came near enough to throw a
harpoon which hit but did not hold a second harpoon failed also but
the third was fastened still she did not attempt to escape but allowed
other boats to approach so that in a few minutes three more harpoons were
fastened and in the course of an hour afterwards she was killed Is it
not extremely painful William to destroy an animal of so much affection
for its young There are also two enemies to the whale found in the sea
the Sword Fish and a cetaceous animal called by our fishermen the Killer
At the sight of the former the whale seems agitated in an extraordinary
manner leaping from the water as if with affright wherever it appears
the whale perceives it at a distance and flies from it in an opposite
direction and having no instrument of defence except its tail it
endeavors to strike it but the Sword Fish is as active as the other is
strong and easily eludes the blow It often cuts the whale in such a
manner as to colour the water all around with blood The Killer is a more
destructive enemy with strong and very powerful teeth A number of these
fish are said to surround the whale some attacking it with their teeth
behind others before till at last he dies from the loss of blood and
what is singular my son it is said that the tongue of the whale is the
only part they devour The whale is naturally a timid animal for it is
said that the Northern Petrel a bird of the genus of the Mother Carys
Chicken of our coasts will sometimes alight upon its back and set
it off in great agitation and terror It is also frequently annoyed by
the larger species of Sharks as the wounds sometimes found upon their
tails evidently show The flesh of the whale is highly prized by the
Esquimaux who not only eat the very fattest part but will drink the oil
with great relish the children also devour the skin raw Capt Lyon
who was present at a feast in an Esquimaux village says the houses
were all lighted up with lamps all the pots were filled with flesh and
the women while cooking pick out and devour the most dainty morsels
One man takes up a large piece applies it to his mouth and severs with
his teeth as much as his mouth can possibly hold then hands it to his
neighbor and he passes it to the next till all is eaten a new piece is
then supplied and thus it continues till they are completely gorged A
young man named Toolooak received into his stomach in 21 hours upwards of
ten pounds of flesh and a gallon and a pint of water The obtaining of
their food is so precarious my son that for many days after this they
may not have a single morsel to eat

BOATSHAND HARPOONBLUBBER LANCEGUN HARPOONMANNER OF TAKING THE WHALE
c

    As when enclosing harpooneers assail
    In wintry seas the slumbering Whale
    Soon as the harpoons pierce the scaly side
    He groans he darts impetuous down the tide
    And rackd all oer with lacerating pain
    He flies remote beneath the flood in vain


The first and principal thing my son in the whaling ships are the
boats which are made to float lightly upon the water their bow and
stern are made sharp and they are capable of being rowed with great
speed and readily turned roundand are of such size as to carry six
or seven men and seven or eight hundred weight of whalelines The
instruments used in the capture are the harpoon and lance besides
these they have used occasionally the harpoongun which is a kind of
swivel This gun was invented in the year 1731 being however difficult
and somewhat dangerous in its application it is now seldom used One of
the most essential particulars in the Dutch whale ships is the Crows
Nest a sort of sentry box made of canvass or light wood pitched on
the maintopmast head This is the post of honor where the master or
officer of the watch often sits for hours provided with a spy glass a
speaking trumpet and a rifle gun As soon as they have arrived in those
seas which are the haunt of the whale the crew are keeping watch day
and nightseven boats are kept hanging by the sides of the ship ready
to be launched in a few minutes The captain or some principal officer
seated in the crows nest surveys the waters and the instant he sees
the back of the huge animal gives notice to the watch who are stationed
upon the deck part of whom leap into the boat and are followed by a
second boat a harpooner being in each Owing to those mighty fields and
mountains of ice the dangers of the Northern or Greenland whale fishery
is ten times greater than are those of this country as our whale ships
take these fish upon the coast of Japan in the Pacific Ocean and upon
the Brazil Banks and always in the open sea There are several rules
among whalers which are observed in approaching this fish to prevent as
far as possible the animal from taking the alarm As the whale is dull
of hearing but quick in sight the boat steerer always endeavors to get
behind it Smooth careful rowing is always requisite and sometimes
sculling is practised Whenever a whale lies on the surface of the
water unconscious of the approach of its enemies the hardy fisher rows
directly upon it and an instant before the boat touches it buries his
harpoon in its back the wounded whale in the surprise and agony of the
moment makes a convulsive effort to escape then my dear son is the
moment of danger The boat is subjected to the most violent blows from
its head or its fins but particularly from its ponderous tail which
sometimes sweeps the air with such tremendous fury that both boat and
men are exposed to one common destruction The head of the whale is
avoided because it cannot be penetrated with the harpoon but any part
of the body between the head and tail will admit of the full length
of the instrument The utmost care is necessary in every person in the
boat while the lines are running outfatal consequences having sometimes
arisen from the entanglement of the line while the whale is going with
amazing swiftness A sailor from Greenock in 1818 happening to step
into the centre of a coil of running rope had his foot entirely carried
off another belonging to the ship Henrietta had carelessly cast some
part of the line under his feet when a sudden dart of the fish made it
twist round his body and he had but just time to cry out Clear away
the line O dear when he was cut almost asunder dragged overboard and
never more seen The immense distances to which whales will run is very
surprising a harpoon was thrown from the boat of the ship Resolution in
1812 into one which run out 10440 yards or about six miles of line
Every boat fast to a living whale carries a flag and the ships to which
such boats belong also wear a flag until the whale is either killed
or makes its escape These signals serve to indicate to surrounding
ships the exclusive title of the fast ship to the entangled whale
and to prevent their interference excepting in the way of assistance
in the capture A full grown whale generally occupies the whole of the
boats belonging to one ship in its capture which sometimes takes the
whole day they have been taken in half an hour from the throwing of the
harpoon The ease with which some whales are killed is truly surprising
but with others it is equally astonishing that neither line nor harpoon
can effect their capture Some escape with four or five harpoons while
others equally large have been killed with a single harpoon indeed
my son whales have been taken by the entanglement of a line without
any harpoon at all One was taken by the crew of the ship Nautilus in
1814 by its accidentally having taken the line into its mouth and by
the compression of its lips they having cut the end of the line from a
whale which they had just killed and as it was sinking in the water
another one engaged in feeding was advancing with its mouth wide open
accidentally caught this line between its extended jaws which induced it
to shut its mouth and grasp the line so firmly as to effect its capture

A whale sometimes causes danger by proving to be alive after having
exhibited every symptom of death Capt Scoresby mentions the instance
of one which appeared so decidedly dead that he himself had leaped on
the tail and was putting a rope through it when he suddenly felt him
sinking from beneath him He made a spring towards a boat that was some
yards distant and grasping its side was drawn on board The fish then
moved forwards reared his tail aloft and shook it with such prodigious
violence that it could have been heard for several miles off After a
few minutes of this violent struggle he rolled on his side and expired

The many accidents which have taken place in the Greenland and
Spitzbergen whale fishery even under the direction of the most
experienced mariners are lamentable and manifold and I will now
William relate to you some of the many which have occurred to the
English and Dutch whalers The most common is that of a ship being beset
and sometimes dashed to pieces by the collision of those mighty masses
or mountains of ice with which northern seas are continually filled The
Blecker Capt Pitt was driven against the ice with such violence that
in an instant all her rigging was dashed in pieces the crew however
escaped upon the ice and after a few days were taken off by a Dutch
ship Capt Bile some years afterwards lost a ship richly laden which
went down suddenly after which the crew wandered in boats over the sea
for fourteen days before they were taken up Thirteen other vessels
perished the same year in those seas Three years afterwards Capt Bile
lost a second ship the crew having just time to save themselves on the
ice

William here asked his father if whale ships were not sometimes lost
at sea Yes my son many fishingships as well as merchantmen have
foundered at sea and have never been heard from since their departure I
remember father says William a piece of poetry which aunt Mary learnt
me a long time since on the loss of a vessel

    Deep in the silent waters
    A thousand fathoms low
    A stately ship lies perishing
    She foundered long ago

    There were blessings poured upon her
    When from her port she sailed
    And prayers and anxious weeping
    Went with her oer the sea

    But how that fine ship perished
    None knew save him on high
    No island heard her signal
    No other bark was nigh

    We only know from Boston
    She sailed far oer the main
    We only know to Boston
    She never came again

You will find my son by referring to Irvings Sketch Book a most
thrilling description of a wreck at sea

The whalefishery is not more distinguished for examples of sudden peril
and besetment than for unexpected deliverance from the most alarming
situations

Three Dutch ships after having completed a rich cargo on the northern
coast of Spitzbergen were at once so completely beset that the crews in
general urged the necessity of proceeding over the ice and endeavoring
to reach some other vessel The captain of one of the three however
strongly urged the obligation of doing all in their power to preserve
such valuable property and they agreed to make a further trial when
in twenty days the ice opened and they had a happy voyage homeward

The Dame Maria Elizabeth had set out early for the fishery and was
so fortunate as by the 30th of May to have taken fourteen whales
Then however a violent gale from the south blew in the ice with such
violence that the captain found himself completely beset and saw two
Dutch vessels and one English go to pieces at a little distance At
length a brisk gale from the north gave him the hope of being extricated
when presently he was involved in a dense fog which froze so thick upon
the sails and rigging that the ship appeared a mere floating iceberg
As the atmosphere cleared the faint light and the birds winging their
way to the southward announced the closing in of winter Unable to
make any progress the seamen looked forward in despair to the prospect
of spending the season in that frozen latitude They had nearly come
to the end of their provisions and famine was already staring them in
the face when they thought of broiling the whales tails which proved
very eatable and even salutary against the scurvy Thus they hoped to
exist till the middle of February beyond which the prospect was very
dismal but on the 12th November there arose a violent north wind which
dispersed the ice Their hopes being now awakened every effort was
strained and on the 18th a northwester brought on so heavy a rain that
next day they were entirely clear of the ice and had a prosperous voyage
homeward

Capt Broerties in the Guillamine arrived on the 22d June at the great
bank of northern ice where he found fifty vessels moored and busied
in the fishery He began it prosperously the very next day indeed he
killed a large whale The day after a tempest drove in the ice with such
violence that twentyseven of the ships were beset of which ten were
lost Broerties on the 25th July seeing some appearance of an opening
caused his ship to be warped through by the boats but after four days
labor she found herself with four other ships in a narrow basin
enclosed by icy barriers on every side

On the 1st August the ice began to gather thick and a violent storm
driving it against the vessels placed them in the greatest peril for a
number of days On the 20th a dreadful gale arose from the northeast
in which the Guillamine suffered very considerable damage In this awful
tempest out of the five ships two went down while a third had sprung
a number of leaks The crews were taken on board of the two remaining
barks which they greatly incommoded On the 25th all the three were
completely frozen in when it was resolved to send a party of twelve men
to seek aid from four vessels which a few days before had been driven
into a station at a little distance but by the time of their arrival two
of these had been dashed to pieces and the other two were in the most
deplorable condition Two Hamburgh ships somewhat farther removed had
perished in a similar manner Meantime the former came in sight of Gale
Hamkes Land in Greenland and the tempest still pushing them gradually
to the southward Iceland at length appeared on their left The two more
distant ships found a little opening through which they contrived to
escape The crews of the three others were beginning to hope that they
might at last be equally fortunate when on the 13th September a whole
mountain of ice fell upon the Guillamine The men half naked leaped
out upon the frozen surface saving with difficulty a small portion of
their provisions The broken remnants of the vessel were soon buried
under enormous piles of ice Of the two other ships one commanded by
Jeldert Janz had just met a similar fate and there remained only that
of one other to which all now looked for refuge By leaping from one
fragment of ice to another the men not without danger contrived to
reach this vessel which though in extreme distress received them on
board Shattered and overcrowded she was obliged immediately after to
accommodate fifty other seamen the crew of a Hamburg ship which had
just gone down the chief harpooner and twelve of the mariners having
perished These numerous companies squeezed into one vessel suffered
every kind of distress Famine in its most direful forms began to
stare them in the face All remoter fears however gave way when on
the 11th October the vessel went to pieces in the same sudden manner
as the others leaving to the unfortunate sailors scarcely time enough
to leap upon the ice with their remaining stores With great difficulty
they reached a field of some extent and contrived with their torn sails
to rear a sort of covering but sensible that by remaining on this
desolate spot they must certainly perish they saw no safety except
in scrambling over the frozen surface to the coast of Greenland which
was in view With infinite toil they effected their object and happily
met some inhabitants who received them hospitably and regaled them
with dried fish and seals flesh Thence they pushed across that dreary
region till they succeeded at length on the 13th March in reaching the
Danish settlement of Frederickshaab Here they were received with the
utmost kindness and being recruited from their fatigues took the first
opportunity of embarking for Denmark whence they afterward sailed to
their native country

The Daviss Strait fishery has also been marked with very frequent and
fatal shipwrecks In 1814 the Royalist Capt Edmonds perished with
all her crew and in 1817 the London Capt Mathews shared the same
fate The only account of either of these ships ever received was from
Capt Bennet of the Venerable who on the 15th April saw the London in
a tremendous storm lying to windward of an extensive chain of icebergs
among which it is probable she was dashed to pieces that very evening
Large contributions were raised at Hull for the widows and families of
the seamen who had suffered on these melancholy occasions

Among accidents on a smaller scale one of the most frequent is that of
boats employed in pursuit of the whale being overtaken by deep fogs or
storms of snow which separate them from the ship and never allow them
to regain it A fatal instance of this kind occurred to the Ipswich
Capt Gordon four of whose boats after a whale had been caught and
even brought to the ships side were employed on a piece of ice hauling
in the line when a storm suddenly arose caused the vessel to drift
away and prevented her notwithstanding the utmost efforts from ever
coming within reach of the unfortunate crews who composed the greater
part of her establishment Mr Scoresby mentions several casualties of
the same nature which occurred to his boats companies all of whom
however in the end happily found their way back One of the most
alarming cases was that of fourteen men who were left on a small piece
of floating ice with a boat wholly unable to withstand the surrounding
tempest but amid their utmost despair they fell in with the Lively of
Whitby and were most cordially received on board

The source however of the most constant alarm to the whalefisher is
connected with the movements of that powerful animal against which
with most unequal strength he ventures to contend Generally indeed
the whale notwithstanding his immense strength is gentle and even
passive seeking even when he is most hotly pursued to escape from his
assailants by plunging into the lowest depths of the ocean Sometimes
however he exerts his utmost force in violent and convulsive struggles
and every thing with which when thus enraged he comes into collision
is dissipated or destroyed in an instant The Dutch writers mention Capt
Vienkes of the ship Barley Mill who after a whale had been struck was
hastening with a second boat to the support of the first The fish
however rose and with its head struck the boat so furiously that it
was shivered to pieces and Vienkes was thrown with its fragments on the
back of the huge animal Even then this bold mariner darted a second
harpoon into the body of his victim but unfortunately he got entangled
in the line and could not extricate himself while the other party were
unable to approach near enough to save him At last however the harpoon
was disengaged and he swam to the boat

Mr Scoresby in one of his earliest voyages saw a boat thrown several
yards into the air from which it fell on its side plunging the crew
into the sea They were happily taken up when only one was found to have
received a severe contusion Capt Lyons of the Raith of Leith on the
Labrador coast in 1802 had a boat thrown fifteen feet into the air it
came down into the water with its keel upwards yet all the men except
one were saved

The crew of Mr Scoresby the elder in 1807 had struck a whale which
soon reappeared but in a state of such violent agitation that no one
durst approach it The captain courageously undertook to encounter it
in a boat by himself and succeeded in striking a second harpoon but
another boat having advanced too close the animal brandished its tail
with so much fury that the harpooner who was directly under judged it
most prudent to leap into the sea The tail then struck the very place
that he had left and cut the boat entirely asunder with the exception
of two planks which were saved by having a coil of ropes laid over
them so that had he remained he must have been dashed to pieces
Happily all the others escaped injury The issues however were not
always so fortunate The Aimwell of Whitby in 1810 lost three men out of
seven and in 1812 the Henrietta of the same port lost four out of six
by the boats being upset and the crews thrown into the sea

In 1809 one of the men belonging to the Resolution of Whitby struck a
sucking whale after which the mother being seen wheeling rapidly round
the spot was eagerly watched Mr Scoresby being on this occasion in
the capacity of harpooner in another boat was selecting a situation for
the probable reappearance of the parent fish when suddenly an invisible
blow stove in fifteen feet of the bottom of his barge which filled with
water and instantly sank The crew were saved


CHAPTER5

PROCEEDINGS AFTER A WHALE IS KILLED


Before a whale can be flensed as the operation of taking off the
fat and whalebone is called some preliminary measures are requisite
These consist in securing the fish to a boat cutting away the attached
whalelines lashing the fins of the whale together and towing it to the
ship

The first operation performed on a dead whale is to secure it to a
boat This is easily effected by lashing it with a rope passed several
times through two holes pierced in the tail to the boats bow The
more difficult operation of freeing the whale from the entanglement
of the lines is then attempted As the whale when dead always lies
on its back or on its side the lines and harpoons are generally far
under water While this is in progress the men of the other boats
having first lashed the tail to a boat are employed in lashing the fins
together across the belly of the whale

On one occasion says a whaler I was engaged in the capture of a fish
upon which when to appearance dead I leaped cut holes in the fins and
was in the act of reeving a rope through them when the fish sunk beneath
my feet As soon as I observed that the water had risen above my knees I
made a spring towards a boat at the distance of three or four yards from
me and caught hold of the gunwale Scarcely was I on board before the
fish began to move forward turned from its back upon its belly reared
its tail aloft and began to shake it with such prodigious violence that
it resounded through the air to the distance of two or three miles After
two or three minutes of this violent exercise it ceased rolled over
upon its side and died

In the year 1816 a fish was to all appearance killed The fins were
partly lashed and the tail on the point of being secured and all the
lines excepting one were cut away the fish meanwhile lying as if dead
To the astonishment and alarm however of the sailors it revived began
to move and pressed forward in a convulsive agitation soon after
it sunk in the water to some depth and then died One line remained
attached to it by which it was drawn up and secured A fish being
properly secured is then taken in tow that is all the boats join
themselves in a line by ropes always carried for the purpose and unite
their efforts in rowing towards the ship The course of the ship in the
mean time is directed towards the boats but in calms or when the ship
is moored to the ice at no great distance or when the situation of the
fish is inconvenient or inaccessible the ship awaits the approach of the
fish

The fish having reached the ship is taken to the larboard side arranged
and secured for flensing For the performance of this operation a variety
of knives and other instruments is requisite

The enormous weight of a whale prevents the possibility of raising it
more than one fourth or one fifth part out of the water except indeed
when it has been some days dead in which case it swells in consequence
of air generated by putrefaction until one third of its bulk appears
above the surface the fish then lying belly upwards extended and well
secured is ready for the operation of flensing

After the whale is properly secured along side of the ship the
harpooners having their feet armed with spurs to prevent them from
slipping descend upon the fish Two boats each of which is under the
guidance of one or two boys attend upon them and serve to hold all
their knives and other apparatus Thus provided the harpooners divide
the fat into oblong pieces or slips by means of blubber spades
and blubber knives then affixing a tackle to each slip flay it
progressively off as it is drawn upwards The flensers commence with the
belly and under jaw being the only part then above water The blubber
in pieces of half a ton each is received on deck and divided into
portable cubical or oblong pieces containing near a solid foot of fat
and passed down between decks when it is packed in a receptacle provided
for it in the hold or other suitable place called the flensgut where
it remains until further convenience

All the fat being taken away from the belly and the right fin removed
the fish is then turned round on its side As the fish is turned round
every part of the blubber becomes successively uppermost and is removed
At length when the whole of the blubber whalebone and jaw bones have
been taken on board the carcass being set at liberty generally sinks in
the water and disappears

When sharks are present they generally help themselves very plentifully
during the cutting up Birds pay close attendance particularly the
larger species of Petrel or Mother Carys Chicken seizing the pieces of
flesh as it falls in the water Gulls also attend in great numbers to
get their share but the large Petrel or Fulmar is decidedly master of
the feast Hence the others are obliged to relinquish the most delicious
morsel when he claims it
